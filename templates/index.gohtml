                Welcome to AdminDev Labs! This is a podcast all about connecting systems engineering and computer science.
                I'm looking to grow and expand in my knowledge and skill set, so I can have a wider variety of topics on the show. I will occassionally do a video 
                as well, mostly for topics that are hard to convey through audio only. If you have any requests, feel free to send them my way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For any questions, comments, concerns, or critique, please e-mail me <a href="mailto:chris@admindev.tech">here</a>. If you don't like the mailto thing, it's chris at admindev dot tech. If you have no questions, commments, conerns, or critique, that's fine too, feel free to reach out. You can also visit the forum to stop and say hi. Check out my source code repositories and LinkedIn below.

        <div class="content">
            <h4>Professional</h4>
            <p>
                I have worked in the I.T. industry for almost 10 years! My interests are systems administration, systems architecture, operating systems, and automation. I also love software development and programming languages.
                Some of my more obscure interests are functional programming, real-time operating systems, and web architecture. My potential dream job would be working at a silicon company like AMD and transitioning into the software engineering side. 
                I am pretty good with Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. I'm working on beefing up my C# and Golang ability. The site you're on right now is written on Go, by the way! ;) 
                Most of my time is spent either on Windows 10 or Debian Buster. I enjoy using all kinds of operating systems, including FreeBSD and OpenBSD! 
            </p>
            <br>
                <h4>Personal</h4>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing guitar, reading, writing, and playing games. I generally play metal, in the spirit of Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, but I enjoy the older generation
                    of heavy metal as well, like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, bands like that. My favorite kinds of books are fantasy, traditional and urban, science fiction, and techno-thrillers.
                    My favorite books of each genre are The Icewind Dale Trilogy, The Dresden Files (White Night was probably my favorite so far), Leviathan Wakes, Zero Day, and Daemon. I play video and tabletop
                    games. My favorite of each is Fallout: New Vegas and HellFrost. Lately, though, my favorite video game has been the next gen CRPG games, Divinity 2, Pillar's of Eternity, etc. I am
                    running a Starfinder game and really enjoying that, dethroning my original favorite. Dungeons and Dragons will always have a special place in my heart, though!

                    I am happily married, live with two cats, and a dog. All of the animals are from various rescue facilities (including the street!).
