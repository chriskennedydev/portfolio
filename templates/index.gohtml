    <h1 id="about_me">About Me</h1>
    <h3 id="professional">Professional</h3>
<p>I have worked in the I.T. industry for almost 10 years. My interests are systems administration, systems architecture, software development, and infrastructure automation. I have spent the last several years moving from an I.T. support and administrator role to a site reliability engineer, devops engineer, and software engineer role.</p>
<p>I am still on the infrastructure side, but I write and build software and administer the &quot;cloud native&quot; side of things. Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Go are more of my day to day. </p>
<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>
<p>I am happily married and live with my wife, two dogs, and two cats. I enjoy reading (yes, books), playing guitar, and watching movies. My favorite movie is Grandma&#39;s Boy. If you&#39;ve never seen it, then what are you doing here? Go check it out! I also like The Departed and Waiting... among other films. </p>
